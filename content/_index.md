## Hello there!
My name is Thomas Fong, though I also go by T! I'm a junior (third-year) in the [**University of Pennsylvania's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences**](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/), working towards an undergraduate degree in [**Digital Media Design**](https://cg.cis.upenn.edu/dmd.html) and a Masters' in [**Computer Graphics and Game Technology**](https://cg.cis.upenn.edu/cggt.html). Both programs are at the intersection of computer science, graphics programming, and art.
