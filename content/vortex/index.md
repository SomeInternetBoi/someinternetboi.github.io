# About
Every Spring semester, the University of Pennsylvania's student chapter of ACM SIGGRAPH works on semester-long group projects. My group opted to work on a mixed 2D/3D animated music video adaptation of BaiShaJAWS's "Vortex". The following is my animated cut, for which I did:
* 2D animation (keys, lineart, coloring, shading)
* 3D environment modeling, including materials
* Procedural effects
* Compositing

# Process
I did the procedural gemstone effect primarily in Blender, using DaVinci Resolve for post-processing (chromatic aberration and bloom).

The gem pattern was a procedural material made using Blender's Shader Editor, mapped to a funnel-shaped object, causing the noise to swirl about the center. It was then animated by setting the noises's texture to a rotating invisible empty object.

The 2D animated portion was done in Procreate, then composited using DaVinci Resolve and After Effects.
