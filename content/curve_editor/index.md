# About
For **Computer Animation Mathematics**, I implemented key interpolation via cubic Bezier curves, cubic Catmull-Rom splines, Hermite splines, and rotational interpolation via quaternion Catmull-Rom splines.

# Features
### Catmull-Rom Splines
I implemented various methods of computing Catmull-Rom splines (1st-order continuous), including:
* **Bernstein Polynomials**
* **DeCasteljau's Algorithm**
* **Matrix Method**
### Hermite Splines
