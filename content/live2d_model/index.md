# About
As I've spent more time watching VTubers, I've found the way they create expressive characters that mimic 3D movements really cool. Over winter break, I decided to take a stab at drawing and rigging one of my own, based on an existing character of mine, Taro Mayeda.

I drew the layers of the model in Procreate, before exporting and rigging it in Live2D. By connecting it to a free software called VTube Studio, the avatar mirrors your movements using your webcam.
