# About
For [**Introduction to Computer Graphics**](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis4600/current/index.html), I worked on a light mesh editor that implemented the half-edge mesh data structure.

# Features
### Mesh Loading From OBJ Files
The program is able to parse and load in .obj files storing 3D meshes.

### Mesh Editing
The program is able to edit meshes via vertex movement, face coloring, and edge splitting.

### Catmull-Clark Subdivision
I implemented [Catmull-Clark subdivision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catmull%E2%80%93Clark_subdivision_surface).
